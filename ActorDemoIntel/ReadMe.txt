 ACTOR - Technology Demo - 27th October 2000 - (c) 2000 Vivid Image


 Optimised for Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4

 This demo has been designed to run on an Intel Pentium 4 machine, with at least 128MB 
 of RAM. We recommend that the demo is run on a NVida GeForce GTS2 graphics card, using 
 either DirectX 7a, or DirectX 8, for best performance.  Please note that you should use 
 the release version of the DirectX runtime library, as there are a number of problems
 with the debug version.  Please make sure you have the latest NVidia driver as well
 (v6.31 or later).

 Playing Pool...

	To play pool you need to click and drag with the left mouse button held down
	on one of the pool balls.  Keep the mouse button held down, and the camera will 
	'rotate' around	the pool ball, allowing you to aim the shot.  Again, keeping the 
	mouse button help down, you can then use the space bar to hit the ball...
	the longer you hold down the space bar, the harder the ball will be hit.  
	When you pot a ball you will be able to see it racking up inside the table, 
	through the transparent	window on the side.  If you pot the white ball, it will 
	be placed in the ball return slot the end of the table.  Clicking on the coin 
	slot will reset the balls.


 Using CTRL + A ...

	If you press CTRL + A whilst dragging an object, you will pin the dragged object
	so it floats in space, dangling from that position.  It will remain there until
	you drag it away again.  This allows objects to be used for target practise, or 
	for the character to kick and punch.  With the dummy you can do this to several
	of its parts at once...for example, if you pin up both of its feet, then it will
	hang upside down.  To release the object again, drag the pinned part (or parts)
	with the mouse.
