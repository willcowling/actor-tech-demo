# MathEngine Info

The Actor technology demos were released in 2000 to showcase the MathEngine physics engine and Intel Pentium 4 processor.

There are two versions:

The **Original** version was released in early 2000 to showcase MathEngine, showing off the core features of the physics engine.

The **Intel** demo was released in late 2000 to showcase the Intel Pentium 4 processor and showed some more advanced features of MathEngine including ragdolls, cloth and water boyancy. This version also used a custom version of MathEngine that was optimised with SSE2 instructions for improved performance.

Now in 2024, you may not of heard of MathEngine but it was one of the first commercially available physics engines, released at GDC (Game Developers Conference) 2000 alongside Havok. It was available for licensing until around 2003 when the company was purchased by Criterion software (EA) and became part of their Renderware Engine. Both of these disappeared a few years later when Renderware failed to take off.

The KarmaUserGuide.pdf in this repo file gives a good overview of the MathEngine 'Karma' physics engine as it was in 2002. A slightly more advanced version to the one included in the Actor demo with more extensive optimisations that had been applied over the years

Although MathEngine was a closed source project, one of its developers, Russell Smith, released an open source physics engine called 'ODE' (Open Dynamics Engine) which uses the same underlying principles as MathEngine. In fact you could consider MathEngine as an optimised, commercial version of ODE.
