ACTOR - Technology Demo - v1.05 (27/06/00)

The Actor Technology Demo features MathEngine's Dynamics Toolkit and our latest 3D game engine. The Dynamics Toolkit is an Alpha version and still being enhanced and optimised. The Actor 3D engine is also undergoing a lot of tweaking and optimisation and new features such as dynamic shadows will be added soon.

This demo demonstrates the successful application of physics in a gaming environment. Manipulate complex physics objects which demonstrate natural behaviour. There are some little surprises to discover too, just click away!
